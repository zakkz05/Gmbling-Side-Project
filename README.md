I wanted to make a higher or lower esc game using Java.
I felt like I got immersed and transformed it into a bit of a gambling experience.
I feel as if this progam also highlights the dangers of gambling and doesn't promote gambling or is affliated with anyone besides my own code.

It is still in the works as I want to create a kind of word associating thing that will see if YeS is close to YES ask if you meant to enter yes and so on.
I also think that i need to handle some of the edge cases and make the text centered and so on but yeah.

Hope you guys enjoy!
